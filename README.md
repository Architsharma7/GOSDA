# SuperCharger

## What is it?

SuperCharger is an SP Explorer to supercharge the data onboarding based on reputation & green score and incentivise RAAS workers to create an immutable, Permanent & unbreakable storage.

## What was the motivation behind it?

1. Proposing deals to Specific SPs on the basis of their Reputation and Green Score is not yet implemented but it can benefit both SPs & User to create a better Storage Ecosystem
2. Registering Job for Renew , Repair & Replication services is not User friendly and un-interactive , with no dashboard for management of this important service.
3. RAAS Workers are not yet incentivised for the service , due to which permanent , immutable & unbreakable storage can't be established.

## What is the Solution?

We built SuperCharger keeping in mind these problems and here is what we came up with:

1. An explorer : Reputation is a crucial factor when selecting a service provider. It reflects the trustworthiness and reliability of the SP.Our explorer ranks SPs based on  the reputation and Green Scores to find the most reputed SP for your deals with sustainable green storage , encouraging SPs to ensure best data availability, at the same time put effort to make rich green environment.

2. Retrieval and Uploading : Users get to upload data with customisations  like encryption and define deal params like renew , repair and replications thresholds & propose deals directly to the SP of their choice . Retrieval is brought by the Saturn CDN to ensure fastest retrieval.

3. RAAS Job Manager : Interactive UI & dashboard to manage your RAAS deals in once click  along with detailed overview of past deals made along with geo data. Raas Jobs are registered via the backend server , and then the workers are incentivised  for performing them.

4. Dashboard: An interactive dashboard for users to see and control their data uploaded to IPFS.

## The Tech Behind it

1. Custom Contract: We use our custom contract for Deal Making and Incentivizing the storage providers, along with proposing RAAS deals.
2. LightHouse: We use Lighthouse SDK for uploading, encrypting, and applying Access Controls.
3. Saturn: We use the Saturn CDN service for the retrieval of user data.
